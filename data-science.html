            <!--Write Up-->
            <div class="card">
                <h2>Project Write Up</h2>
                <p>Our team built a complete data and machine learning pipeline that uses the given MiSpace NetCDF dataset to produce accurate and human readable ice concentration forecasts for the Great Lakes. 
                    The project includes data preparation and a forecasting model and a visualization pipeline and clear documentation that explains each part of the system.</p>
                <p>We started with the provided NetCDF files for January 11 to 31. 
                    These files contain daily 1024x1024 environmental grids with latitude and longitude and a temperature variable that represents ice concentration. 
                    We manually organized the dataset into the correct order and checked each file for consistency. 
                    We confirmed that the temperature field formed a time series across the 21 days. 
                    This gave us a clean historical dataset that could be used to train a forecasting model.</p>
                <p>To build the predictor, we trained a U-Net model on these daily grids. 
                    The model takes the previous seven days of ice concentration as input and predicts the next day’s full 1024x1024 map. 
                    This turns the problem into a supervised sequence to image forecast. 
                    We trained the model for 5 to 10 epochs per cycle and repeated the process across several generations of improvements over multiple weeks. 
                    Each version of the model was tested and reviewed. 
                    This helped us correct issues such as drift or missing ice regions and unrealistic shapes in longer predictions. 
                    Through careful tuning and evaluation, we reached a stable configuration that produced visually realistic outputs.</p>
                <p>After training, we used the final seven January days, January 25 to 31, to predict February 1 through 4. 
                    Each prediction was fed back into the next input window so the system could forecast multiple days into February. 
                    The outputs were saved as high resolution PNGs so they would be easy to interpret. 
                    Each image uses a fixed 0 to 6 color scale that matches the original dataset. 
                    Darker blue represents higher ice concentration and lighter blue represents lower levels or open water. 
                    The axes represent the spatial layout of the lakes with longitude on the x axis and latitude on the y axis. 
                    The data is flipped vertically when displayed so north appears at the top in the final images.</p>
                <p>We also generated GIF animations that show the forecasted days in sequence. 
                    This makes it easy to see how the model expects ice to grow or retreat across the lakes. 
                    Each run of the predictor is saved in its own numbered directory so results remain organized as the project evolves.</p>
                <p>The GitHub Pages dashboard now includes updated documentation that explains the dataset and the ML pipeline. 
                    It also explains the data preparation steps and provides examples of the output. 
                    The repository structure shows where data and models and processing tools and notebooks are located.</p>
                <p>This project meets the hackathon requirements by using the provided dataset directly and producing a working Great Lakes ice forecasting system. 
                    It also presents the outputs in a readable and scientifically meaningful format. 
                    Using only the January 11 to 31 data, our final pipeline produced consistent predictions for February 1 to 4 that preserve the spatial structure of the lakes and follow realistic ice trends. 
                    This demonstrates that machine learning can support short term ice forecasting when combined with careful data handling and multiple training iterations.</p>

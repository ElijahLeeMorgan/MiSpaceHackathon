                <h2>About Forecast Data</h2>
                <p>The output PNGs and GIF show the model's predicted ice concentration maps for each forecasted day. 
                    Each image is a full 1024x1024 grid pulled directly from the structure of the original NetCDF files, which means that every pixel corresponds to the same spatial location on the Great Lakes as in the real dataset. 
                    The x-axis represents longitude and the y-axis represents latitude.</p>
                <p>Each pixel's color reflects the predicted ice concentration value from the model. 
                    We use a fixed color scale from 0 to 6 so the meaning stays consistent across all days. 
                    In the original January data, values near 0 represent open water and higher values represent thicker or more complete ice cover. 
                    On this scale, darker blues correspond to higher ice values and lighter or washed-out blues represent lower values. 
                    The color bar on the right side of each image stays constant so you can compare predictions across time.</p>
                <p>Additionally, the PNGs represent single-day predictions, one for each day the model generates. 
                    The GIF combines all PNGs into a time-lapse showing how the model expects ice to grow or shift across the lakes. 
                    Because the spatial grid is preserved, you can track ice changes across the region.</p>
